            <h2>Anatomy of the Heart</h2>
            <p>The human heart is a powerful, fist-sized muscular organ located in the center of the chest within the mediastinum, slightly tilted toward the left side, and protected by the rib cage. It weighs approximately 250–350 grams in adults and serves as the central pump of the circulatory system, divided into four chambers: two upper atria and two lower ventricles, separated by a muscular septum to prevent mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.
The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava, while the left atrium collects oxygen-rich blood returning from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. Blood then flows from the atria into the ventricles through atrioventricular valves—the tricuspid valve on the right side (with three cusps) and the mitral (bicuspid) valve on the left side (with two cusps)—which are anchored by chordae tendineae and papillary muscles to prevent backflow during contraction. The thicker-walled ventricles pump blood out of the heart: the right ventricle sends deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary trunk and pulmonary arteries through the pulmonary valve, while the left ventricle, the strongest chamber, propels oxygenated blood into the aorta and the rest of the body through the aortic valve. Both semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic) have three cusps and ensure one-way flow by closing when ventricular pressure drops.
The heart wall consists of three layers: the thin outer epicardium (visceral pericardium), the thick contractile myocardium made of cardiac muscle, and the smooth inner endocardium that lines the chambers and valves. Surrounding the heart is the pericardium, a double-layered sac that reduces friction during beating. Major external features include the coronary sulcus separating atria from ventricles, the anterior and posterior interventricular sulci marking the septum, and prominent auricles (ear-like flaps) on the atria.
The heart's own blood supply comes from the coronary arteries branching directly from the aorta, while cardiac veins drain deoxygenated blood back into the right atrium via the coronary sinus. This intricate anatomy enables the heart to beat continuously—around 100,000 times per day—coordinating efficient, unidirectional blood flow through pulmonary and systemic circulations while maintaining separation of oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood.

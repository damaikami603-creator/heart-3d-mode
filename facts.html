            <h2>Interesting Scientific Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your heart is roughly the size of a fist (in children) or about the size of two fists clasped together (in adults). It typically weighs 7–15 ounces (around 250–350 grams), with men's hearts averaging slightly heavier than women's.</li>
                <li>A healthy adult heart beats about 100,000 times per day (roughly 60–100 beats per minute at rest). Over an average lifetime, that's more than 2.5 billion beats — and up to ~3 billion in some estimates.</li>
                <li>Every minute, your heart pumps approximately 1.5 gallons (about 5.7 liters) of blood. In a single day, that adds up to roughly 2,000 gallons, enough to fill a small swimming pool over time.</li>
                <li>The heart generates enough energy each day to drive a truck about 20 miles. Over a lifetime, it produces enough energy to travel to the moon and back.</li>
                <li>Women's hearts generally beat faster than men's — on average about 8 beats per minute quicker — partly because a woman's heart is slightly smaller and must work faster to circulate the same volume of blood.</li>
                <li>Newborn babies have the fastest heart rates, typically 70–190 beats per minute, which gradually slows as they grow.</li>
                <li>The "lub-dub" sound of a heartbeat comes from the opening and closing of the heart's four valves (tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic), which prevent blood from flowing backward.</li>
                <li>Your heart is not located entirely on the left side (as many people think) — it's almost in the center of your chest, tilted so a portion taps against the left rib cage, which is why it feels left-sided.</li>
                <li>The heart has its own built-in electrical system (the cardiac conduction system) that triggers every beat. Remarkably, a healthy heart can continue beating for a short time even when disconnected from the body (as long as it has oxygen).</li>
                <li>Your body contains about 60,000 miles of blood vessels. The blood your heart pumps travels roughly 12,000 miles per day — about four times the distance across the United States coast to coast.</li>
                <li>Over a lifetime, the heart pumps around 1 million barrels of blood (enough to fill multiple large tankers).</li>
            </ul>
